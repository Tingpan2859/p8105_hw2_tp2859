``` r
transit_data <- read.csv("NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv")
```

``` r
transit_clean <- transit_data %>%
  select(Line, Station.Name, Station.Latitude, Station.Longitude, Route1:Route11, 
         Entrance.Type, Entry, Vending, ADA)
transit_clean <- transit_clean %>%
  mutate(Entry = ifelse(Entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE))
```

\#Describe the dataset The dataset contains information about the
entrances and exits of subway stations in New York City. Key variables
include: line, station, name, station latitude / longitude, routes
served, entry, vending, entrance type, and ADA compliance. I used
read.csv to read the file. Then I selected the varibale that should be
retained to get a new table named transit_clean. Next, by using mutate
function and ifelse, I convert the entry variable from character to a
logical variable.

The resulting data set has 1868 rows and 19 columns.

The dataset which named transit_clean is not tidy because the subway
routes are spread across multiple columns.

\##a. How many distinct stations are there?

``` r
distinct_stations <- transit_clean %>%
  distinct(Line, Station.Name) %>%
  nrow()
```

There are 465 distinct stations.

\##b. How many stations are ADA-compliant?

``` r
ada_compliant <- transit_clean %>%
  filter(ADA == TRUE) %>%
  distinct(Line, Station.Name) %>%
  nrow()
```

There are 84 stations that are ADA compliant.

\##c.What proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow
entrance?

``` r
entry_withoutvending <- transit_clean %>%
  filter(Vending == "NO", Entry == TRUE) %>%
  nrow()
total_withoutvending <- transit_clean %>%
  filter(Vending == "NO") %>%
  nrow()
proportion_withoutvending <-entry_withoutvending/total_withoutvending
```

There are 0.3770492 proportion of station entrances / exits without
vending allow entrance.

\##reformat

``` r
transit_clean <- transit_clean %>%
  mutate(across(Route1:Route11, as.character))

transit_clean_re <- transit_clean %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = Route1:Route11, names_to = "Route_Number", values_to = "Route") %>%
  filter(!is.na(Route))
#distinct stations serve the A train
The_A_train_stations <- transit_clean_re %>%
  filter(Route == "A") %>%
  distinct(Line, Station.Name) %>%
  nrow()

add_compliant_A <- transit_clean_re %>%
  filter(Route == "A",ADA == "TRUE") %>%
  distinct(Line, Station.Name) %>%
  nrow()
```

There are 60 distinct stations serve the A train. Of the stations that
serve the A train, there are 17 ADA compliant.

\#Describe data cleaning process I read the data first. However, I
forgot to skip 2 rows in results.csv which made me cannot do the next
steps. Then I rename the cols in different files to merge these files to
form a dataset that I named final_data. At first, I used anti_join
function to check whether my data are complete and correct. But I found
out there’s a baker named ‘jo’ is missing. Then I checked the files by
myself, and find out there’s a Jo in bakers, and there’s a ‘Jo’ in
bakes.Then I used mutate to remove the ’’ symbol and finally I got the
right answer. I also found that the name of baker in bakers file and
bakes file are different, which cause the missing value in my final_data
set. And I use mutate function again to solve the problem. When I think
everything have been done well, I found that I forgot to add “Episode”
as a requirement when I used lef_join to form the final_data set.
Fortunatlely, I found the problem out and get the right result. The
final_data show us all the baker have attended the Great British Bake
Off.We can use the final_data dataset to find the baker by
Epsiode,Series,hometown,signature bake,etc. It’s useful and
comprehensive.

star_bakers <- final_data %>%

# Display the table of Star Bakers
star_bakers_table <- star_bakers %>%
  arrange(Series, Episode)
```

\#Comment on this table – were there any predictable overall winners?
Any surprises? According to the table I got, we cannot predict overall
winners by the “Star baker”. For example, Richard have got 5 times Star
baker reward, but the final winner is Nancy. The result is
counterintuitive and surprising.
